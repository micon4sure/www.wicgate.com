# SPA Fallback Routing Configuration
#
# Purpose: Enables client-side routing for Vue Router (path-based navigation)
# Platform Support: Works on Netlify, Vercel, and other platforms
#
# How it works:
# - All unmatched routes (/*) redirect to /index.html with 200 status
# - Vue Router then handles the route on the client side
# - Maintains SSG benefits: crawlers see pre-rendered HTML, users get SPA experience
#
# Note: GitHub Pages (current deployment) uses 404.html instead
# This file is retained for platform portability (if switching to Netlify/Vercel)

/*    /index.html   200
