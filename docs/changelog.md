### October 14, 2025 - Auth Guard + Data Polling Resilience

**Highlights**
- Login (`/login`) and admin (`/admin`) route guards now await `authStore.checkAuth()` on first load so persisted sessions survive hard refreshes before role checks run.
- Admin dashboard bootstraps `useAppDataStore().init()` on mount, guaranteeing live polling even when the admin view is the entry point.
- App data store automatically schedules recovery fetches and listens for the browser `online` event after exhausting retries, restoring polling without a full reload.
- Sitemap generator derives URLs from `NAVIGATION_STRUCTURE`, producing a 23-route `public/sitemap.xml` that mirrors every pre-rendered section and subsection.
- Ran `npm run test:thorough` and `npm run lint` to confirm the resilience changes didn't introduce regressions.

### October 14, 2025 - SSR/SSG Metadata & Asset Hardening

**Highlights**
- Migrated all route head definitions into `src/content/pageMeta.ts`, providing a single source of truth for titles, descriptions, keywords, OG assets, and canonicals.
- Added `scripts/apply-head-meta.ts` plus a `postbuild:head` step so every ViteSSG HTML artifact is rewritten with the page-specific head metadata (24 routes total).
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to respect a `DEPLOY_BASE` env variable (default `/`); this fixes broken `/assets/*` URLs when serving nested SSG pages and excludes gated `/admin` from the SSG pass entirely.
- Regenerated sitemap via `scripts/generate-sitemap.ts` (now 22 routes) and refreshed PWA icons in `public/` during the build pipeline.
- Verified via `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:thorough` to ensure the SSR output and asset references are stable.

## October 2025

### October 16, 2025 - Code Quality & Security Improvements

**Highlights**
- Fixed missing @vitest/coverage-v8 dependency causing test coverage to fail (critical blocker for CI/CD pipelines)
- Added prominent mock authentication warnings to production builds: visual banner in Admin dashboard, demo mode notice in Login page, console error in auth store
- Created comprehensive security documentation (docs/security.md) covering XSS prevention strategies, authentication security concerns, API security best practices, storage security, and deployment checklist
- Extracted magic numbers to constants.ts: SERVER_MAX_CAPACITY (16 players), SERVER_CAPACITY_THRESHOLDS (90% full, 50% medium, 0% low)
- Migrated 3 most-used legacy CSS variables to Tailwind utilities across 8 files: --g ‚Üí bg-online, --t3 ‚Üí text-t-tertiary, --bd ‚Üí border-mg
- Added security comments to usePlayerDisplay.ts documenting hex validation preventing CSS injection
- All 44 tests passing, TypeScript strict mode clean, ESLint zero errors

**Technical Details**

**Phase 1 - Critical Fixes:**
- `package.json`: Installed @vitest/coverage-v8@3.0.0 as dev dependency (required by vitest.config.ts)
- `src/views/Admin.vue`: Added prominent mock auth warning banner with red border/background, icon, and bold text after line 82
- `src/views/Login.vue`: Added demo mode warning notice with red styling and Flask icon after line 65
- `src/stores/auth.ts`: Added production environment check logging critical error when mock auth detected in production build (after line 11)
- `docs/security.md`: Created 250+ line comprehensive security guide covering XSS prevention (v-html usage analysis, sanitization strategies), authentication security (mock auth risks, production recommendations), API security (CORS, rate limiting), storage security (localStorage risks), vulnerability reporting, and deployment security checklist
- `src/composables/usePlayerDisplay.ts`: Added inline security comment at hex validation documenting CSS injection prevention (line 75-77)

**Phase 2 - High Priority:**
- `src/constants.ts`: Added SERVER_MAX_CAPACITY constant (16) and SERVER_CAPACITY_THRESHOLDS object (FULL: 0.9, MEDIUM: 0.5, LOW: 0) after line 9
- `src/screens/Multiplayer.vue`: Updated player count display to use SERVER_MAX_CAPACITY constant instead of hard-coded 16 (line 139)
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Added t-tertiary color (#6c7a85) to text hierarchy for muted text (line 88)
- `src/components/Footer.vue`: Migrated 4 CSS variable usages to Tailwind classes (bg-graphite-dark, border-mg, text-t-tertiary, bg-online)
- `src/components/LeaderboardGroup.vue`: Replaced var(--t3) with text-t-tertiary in 2 locations (lines 173, 265)
- `src/components/TwitchFacade.vue` & `src/components/TwitchEmbed.vue`: Migrated var(--s2) ‚Üí bg-graphite-light, var(--bd) ‚Üí border-mg
- `src/composables/useServerCapacity.ts`: Changed getCapacityColor() to return hex colors directly (#e53935 red, #ff6600 orange, #7cb342 green) instead of CSS variables (lines 53-55)

**Why This Matters**
- Test coverage now works in CI/CD pipelines (previously failed with "Cannot find dependency" error)
- Mock authentication now has visible warnings preventing accidental production deployment
- Security documentation provides clear guidance for production hardening (real auth backend, XSS prevention, deployment checklist)
- Magic number extraction improves maintainability (single source of truth for server capacity)
- CSS variable migration reduces technical debt and improves type safety (Tailwind IntelliSense works better with utility classes)

### October 17, 2025 - Leaderboard Divider Cleanup

- Removed table header and body border utilities from the statistics leaderboard so the cards no longer show unintended white seams between cells.
- Kept hover highlights using existing orange gradient utilities; no changes to data fetching or row rendering.

**Files**
- `src/components/LeaderboardGroup.vue`

### October 15, 2025 - ESLint 9 Migration (Security Update)

**Highlights**
- Upgraded from ESLint 8.57.1 (end-of-life October 5, 2024) to ESLint 9.37.0 for continued security patch support.
- Migrated from deprecated `.eslintrc.json` format to modern flat config (`eslint.config.js`) as required by ESLint 9.
- Upgraded all ESLint-related packages: `eslint-plugin-vue` (9.33.0 ‚Üí 10.5.0), `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` (8.44.0 ‚Üí 8.46.1), `vue-eslint-parser` (‚Üí 10.2.0).
- Added comprehensive browser globals (DOM, Fetch API, Service Workers) and Node.js globals to flat config to eliminate `no-undef` errors.
- Verified zero breaking changes: all 44 tests passing (`npm run test:thorough`), TypeScript compilation clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`), linting passes with 0 errors, Prettier integration working, build scripts functional.
- Configuration files (`*.config.ts/js`) and `scripts/**` properly ignored by ESLint as intended.

**Technical Details**
- `package.json`: Updated ESLint and related plugins to latest compatible versions with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for peer dependency resolution
- `eslint.config.js`: Created new flat config with ESM imports, explicit plugin registration, comprehensive globals definition, preserved all custom rules (unused var patterns, Prettier integration, Vue-specific overrides)
- `.eslintrc.json`: Deleted deprecated config file after successful migration
- All source files (`.ts`, `.vue`) lint cleanly with new configuration
- Pre-commit hooks continue to work without modification
- `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix` commands unchanged

**Why This Matters**
- ESLint 8 reached end-of-life on October 5, 2024 and no longer receives security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities
- Flat config is the future of ESLint configuration and will be the only format supported in ESLint 10 (expected early 2025)
- Proactive migration ensures continued security support and compatibility with future ESLint ecosystem updates
- Zero disruption to development workflow - all existing scripts, hooks, and IDE integrations continue to work

### October 14, 2025 - @unhead/vue Migration (Head Management Library)

**Highlights**
- Migrated from deprecated `@vueuse/head@2.0.0` to modern `@unhead/vue@1.11.18` (official successor maintained by the Unhead team).
- Fixed critical API difference: changed `children` property to `textContent` in all `useHead()` script blocks for proper JSON-LD rendering during ViteSSG build.
- Removed manual head setup from `src/main.ts` since vite-ssg v28+ automatically integrates @unhead/vue (no `createHead()` needed).
- Verified structured data renders correctly during SSG: both @unhead/vue AND post-build script now inject JSON-LD (belt-and-suspenders approach).
- All 44 tests passing, build successful, structured data properly formatted in all 22 pre-rendered pages.

**Technical Details**
- `package.json`: Replaced `@vueuse/head@2.0.0` with `@unhead/vue@1.11.18` in devDependencies
- `src/main.ts`: Removed `import { createHead } from '@vueuse/head'` and manual head setup (lines 132-134), added comment explaining vite-ssg v28+ auto-integration
- `src/views/Home.vue`: Changed import to `@unhead/vue`, replaced `children:` with `textContent:` in both Organization and WebSite schema script blocks
- Result: Structured data now renders during SSG via @unhead/vue, with post-build script as backup safety net

**Why This Matters**
- @vueuse/head is officially sunset/deprecated, @unhead/vue is the maintained successor integrated with modern build tools
- Using `children` property with @unhead/vue produces malformed HTML attributes instead of proper JSON-LD content
- Future-proof foundation: when tailwind branch merges to master, it brings modern, maintained library with correct API usage
- Belt-and-suspenders approach ensures structured data works even if library behavior changes

### October 14, 2025 - Structured Data SEO Fix + Code Cleanup

**Highlights**
- Extended `scripts/apply-head-meta.ts` to inject JSON-LD structured data during post-build processing, fixing a critical SEO gap where @vueuse/head v2 doesn't render `<script>` tags during SSG.
- Added Organization schema to all 22 pre-rendered pages and WebSite schema to homepage for rich search results and Google Knowledge Panel eligibility.
- Cleaned up unused imports/variables from store initialization refactoring: removed `onMounted` from Admin.vue, removed unused `authStore` from Home.vue.
- Build validation now passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings (previously had 22 warnings for missing structured data).
- Verified with `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and new `npm run validate:build` command.

**Technical Details**
- `apply-head-meta.ts`: Added `injectStructuredData()` function that imports schemas from `src/utils/structuredData.ts` and injects minified JSON-LD before `</head>` tag
- All 22 routes now include proper schema.org Organization markup with name, logo, description, social links, and founding date
- Homepage additionally includes WebSite schema with search action for enhanced search engine integration
- Created `scripts/validate-build.ts` for automated post-build quality checks (favicon paths, canonical URLs, meta tags, structured data)
